## TRISEASE
Trisease is simply a mouth opening smart device used for physiotherapy of patients suffering form Trismus disease, have difficulty in moving their lower jaw and thus need physiotherapy to overcome the stiffness.
The device halps them to excercise independently as well as monitor their progress by recording their data of distance moved by the lower jaw, the amount of force patient applied to achieve that much distance as well as 
the number of cycles of exercises perfromed by the patient.
Nonetheless, it communicates the data to a mobile application via WiFi, which can be accessible to the doctor from anywhere! ensuring easy monitoring of the patient.

## SENSORS
We have used Flex sensor to measure force applied by the patient and an analog based Infrared sensor to determine the linear distance jaws have moved.
